# Movie_Genre_Classifier (NLP- classification)
Classifier movies on plot summary

This assessment is a text classification project where the goal is to classify the genre of a movie based on its characteristics, primarily the text of the plot summarization. You have a training set of data that you will use to identify and create your best predicting model. Then you will use that model to predict the classes of the test set of data. We will compare the performance of your predictions to your classmates using the weighted F1 Score.

The movie_train.csv dataset contains information (Release Year, Title, Plot, Director, Cast) about 10,682 movies and the label of Genre. There are 9 different genres in this data set, so this is a multiclass problem. You are expected to primarily use the plot column, but can use the additional columns as you see fit.

The test set of data, contains 3,561 movies with all of their information except the Genre.
